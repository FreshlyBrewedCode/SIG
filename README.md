# SIG

SIG is a Unity editor tool/framework for **S**ynthetic **I**mage dataset **G**eneration using a node-based workflow. SIG was developed in the scope of my 2021 bachelor thesis "Synthetic image dataset generation for the training of deep learning models using node-based workflows" at the "Hochschule Hannover" in the course of studies "Mediendesigninformatik".
